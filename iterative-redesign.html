        <h2>Iterative Redesign: Apriora</h2>
        <div class ="project">
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Apriora is a startup looking to revolutionize the way recruiters screen and interview candidates. The goal of Apriora is to utilize AI to conduct behavioral and technical interviews with candidates. This takes the brunt of the work off the shoulders of recruiters, as using AI to conduct interviews allows companies to quickly screen candidates without needing their employees to take time to conduct lengthy interviews. This product conducts interviews in a web app on a desktop, in which the user will join a video call, where the interviewer is an AI model. The candidate will be asked questions just like a normal interview. After, the interview will be analyzed and a report will be presented to the recruiter, allowing them to make judgements about the candidate.</p> 
            <p> We come in looking to iteratively design the Apriora interface based on its concept. By making sketches, creating wireframes, visiting critique sessions, and testing a Hi-Fi prototype with outside users, we will have successfully created our own design for Apriora. Through this, we hope to further the goal of Apriora as well as make this process more welcoming and an accurate replication of an interview for candidates.                 
            </p>

        <h3>Sketching and Brainstorming</h3>
        <p>The first step in this process is to brainstorm individually how the design could look, and sketching those ideas out. Take a look at the sketches the team came up with to work towards reducing time and effort for recruiters, enhance objectivity and quality in candidate evaluations, and create a smooth and human like experience for candidates
