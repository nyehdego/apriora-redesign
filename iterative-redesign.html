        <h2>Iterative Redesign: Apriora</h2>
        <div class ="project">
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Apriora is a startup looking to revolutionize the way recruiters screen and interview candidates. The goal of Apriora is to utilize AI to conduct behavioral and technical interviews. This takes the work off the shoulders of recruiters, as using AI to conduct interviews allows companies to quickly screen candidates without needing their employees to take time to conduct lengthy interviews. </p> 
            <p>This product conducts interviews in a web app on a desktop, in which the user will join a video call, where the interviewer is an AI model. The candidate will be asked questions just like a normal interview. After, the interview will be analyzed and a report will be presented to the recruiter, allowing them to make judgements about the candidate.</p>
            <p> We come in looking to iteratively design the Apriora interface based on its concept. By making sketches, creating wireframes, visiting critique sessions, and testing a Hi-Fi prototype with outside users, we will have successfully created our own design for Apriora. Through this, we hope to further the goal of Apriora as well as make this process more welcoming and an accurate replication of an interview for candidates. </p>

        <h3>Sketching and Brainstorming</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Brainstormed individually how the design could look and sketched those ideas out</li>
            <li>Emphasized reducing time and effort for recruiters</li>
            <li>Focused on enhancing objectivity and quality in candidate evaluations</li>
            <li>Aimed to create a smooth, human‑like experience for candidates</li>
            <li>Faced the challenge that each sketch featured compelling icon usage, screen proportions, layouts, and simplicity levels</li>
            <li>Held open discussions to debate which elements to keep or discard</li>
            <li>Merged the strongest aspects of clear icons, balanced screen sizes and intuitive flows—into one cohesive design</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Wireframe</h3>
        <p>Remembering the problems we want to solve, and after putting our ideas and sketches together, we created a scheduling screen wireframe, a waiting room wireframe, and a meeting room wireframe:</p>
        <div class="wireframe-section">
        <img src="./assets/WireframeSchedulingScreen.png" alt="Wireframed Scheduling Screen" width="330">
        <img src="./assets/WireframeWaitingRoom.png" alt="Wireframed Waiting Room" width="330">
        <img src="./assets/WireframeMeetingRoom.png" alt="Wireframed Meeting Room" width="330">
        </div>
        <div class="input-section">
            <h4>First Sketch: Scheduling Screen</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>We kept the option to scheudle an interview to keep the product human-like as if the candidate was booking an interview with another person. This is important especially for candidates who may be nervous about conducting an interview with an AI bot.</li>
                <li>Through our converstaions we found that we would like to improve this with intuitive colors and a layout for easier use</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="input-section">
            <h4>Second Sketch: Waiting Room Screen</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>We retained key interface components like the facecam, microphone, and volume output options as well as added a time indicator to join when it came to a traditional meeting room screen. </li>
                <li> While these may seem intuitive, we realized through discussion that they are often overlooked in design despite being crucial for a smooth user experience.</li>
            </ul></li>
        </div>
        <div class="input-section">
            <h4>Third Sketch: Meeting Room Screen</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>We included a dual transcript feature to ensure clarity during the interview, allowing both parties to reference what was said in real time.</li>
                <li>We also made sure to keep the interviewee’s face visible to add a human touch and allow them to still see themselves.</li>
                <li>Throughout our converstaions we arrived to a point that we still wanted to explore how the AI should visually appear. For instance, whether this AI should appear as a human-like figure or with no appearance at all as this impacts the comfort and realism of an interview.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Overall, our design choices aim to balance a clean, professional look with straightforward usability, aligning with our group’s goal of making the AI interview experience feel as natural and accessible as possible. The wireframes are black & white by design — to focus on layout, structure, and core functionality before styling.</p>

        <h3>Time for Critiques</h3>
        <p>When we attended a critique session, we got valuable feedback to take into the next step of building our Hi Fi-Prototype.</p>
        <div class="input-section">
            <ul>
                <li>Add more branding relating to the company the conducting interviews</li>
                <li>Add customization options for each company</li>
                <li>Think deeply about how navigating between screens should feel</li>
                <li>Add more screens in the prototype demonstrating the recruiter’s experience setting up interviews to solve the original problem presented by the startup</li>
                <li>Make sure the Hi Fi-Prototype has a professional apperance</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>These critiques went a long way into the look of our Hi-Fi Prototype. We especially focused on creating an experience from the perspective of a recruiter as well as making the process for comfortable for the user.</p>
        <div class="input-section">
            <h4>To continue to solve our design goals, here's what we implemented into our prototypes based on our wireframing critique session that we attended:</h4>
            <ul>
                <p><strong>→ used for justification of choices!</strong></p>
                <li>Added three screens &rarr; demonstrates the recruiter perspective</li>
                <li>Ability for recruiters to customize logo, colors, and AI name &rarr; to allow for the coordination of the interviewing company's branding</li>
                <li>Made icons and colors consistent with each other &rarr; allows for a cohesive, vibrant, and memorable user experience</li>
                <li>Added responsive elements like button hover, camera toggle, scrollable elements, and multi-screen navigatio &rarr; for an engaging, smooth, modern, and user experience</li>
            </ul>

        In our Figma walkthrough video, <strong>key interactions</strong> and <strong>navigation experiences</strong> are clearly labeled throughout the app.
        </p>
        <h3>User Testing</h3>
    <p>To wrap up or iteratrive design process, we took this prototype to users who tested our design. We each conducted one user test with the following instructions:</p>
    <div class="input-section">
      <p>Task: As a recruiter would, create an interview, send it out, and find the ‘accuracy’ metric on the metrics screen.</p>
      Additional Instructions:
      <ul>
        <li>Ask the user to think out loud as they use the interface, relating to their intuition and thoughts on their design. Take notes.</li>
        <li>
          Ask these questions after their test is over:
          <ul>
            <li>If anything, what was confusing?</li>
            <li>What was most straightforward?</li>
            <li>Is there anything you would change?</li>
            <li>Did you feel like you got more comfortable or less comfortable as you progressed through the task</li>
            <li>How did the interface support/hinder your ability to complete the task</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    Usability Test Findings:
    <ul>
        <li>Participants successfully completed the primary task with varying degrees of efficiency.</li>
        <li>Users frequently overlooked explanatory text throughout the interface</li>
        <li>Expressed uncertainty about the workflow transition between sending the interview and the calendar screen</li>
        <li>Participants generally reported becoming more comfortable with the interface as they progressed through its linear flow.</li>
        <li>
        Based on these findings, several interface improvements are recommended to address the specific points of confusion:
        <ul>

          <li>Clearer labeling (specifically changing "Role" to "Candidate Role")</li>
          <li>Adding contextual help through tooltips and information buttons</li>
          <li>Breaking up long text blocks into more digestible content</li>
          <li>Ensuring intuitive color coding for metrics visualization</li>
          <li>Provide additional navigation flexibility while maintaining the appreciated linear progression</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Through this iterative redesign process, we were able to develop a thoughtful interface for Apriora that balances innovation with human-centered design principles. Furthermore, we created a solution that addresses the core goals of reducing recruiter workload while maintaining a natural interview experience for candidates.</p>
    <p>Our journey from initial sketches to high-fidelity prototypes revealed important insights about designing AI-mediated human interactions. We discovered that users require clear labeling, intuitive navigation paths, and reassuring human elements even when interacting with artificial intelligence.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the user testing phase highlighted specific areas for improvement, particularly around terminology clarity, contextual guidance, and intuitive metrics visualization. These findings demonstrate that even with innovative technology, fundamental usability principles remain essential.</p>
    <p> Overall, the balance between efficiency and familiarity proved crucial to mimiking traditional human interviews and as AI continues to enter human resource processes, designs must carefully consider both the recruiter and candidate perspectives to create truly effective solutions</p>
    <!-- <p>The Apriora redesign ultimately represents more than just an interface improvement, it showcases how thoughtful iteration can help bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI capabilities and the human experiences they're meant to enhance. By addressing both functional requirements and emotional considerations, our design works toward a future where technology empowers rather than replaces human connection in the hiring process.</p> -->
